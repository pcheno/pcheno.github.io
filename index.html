                    Three weeks ago my wife and I went to Los Angeles were we went to a taping of the Conan Obrien show.  Before the show a comedian 
                    comes out and gets the crowd in a good mood. At the end of the comedian's show, he selected several people from the audience
                    for a dance off.  We'll I got selected and won. Then Conan came out and greeted me and referenced to us during the show a few times.</p>

                <p>Graduated from Iowa State University 30 years ago with a B.S. in Computer Engineering.  Needless to say things are done a 
                    little differently today. Hopefully by July I can program myself out of a wet bag.</p>
